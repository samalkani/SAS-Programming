/* Parametric Models with Proc LifeReg */

/* Proc lifetest can be used to plot Kaplan-Meier (KM) log-log curves against log of time. If the curves are approximately straight lines and parallel then the assumption for the Weibull distribution has been met. If the KM curves additionally have a slope of 1 (special case of Weibull distribution) the model fits an exponential distribution. */

/* The parameter estimate for clinic is 214.2525. The interpretation for this estimate is that the MEDIAN SURVIVAL TIME (or time to any fixed value of S(t)) is estimated at 214 days more for clinic=2 compared to clinic=1. In other words, you add 214 days to the estimated MEDIAN SURVIVAL TIME for clinic=1 to get the estimated MEDIAN SURVIVAL TIME for clinic=2. This contrasts from the previous AFT model in which you multiply estimated MEDIAN SURVIVAL TIME for clinic=2. THE ADDITIVE MODEL CAN BE VIEWED AS A SHIFTING OF SURVIVAL TIME WHILE THE AFT MODEL CAN BE VIEWED AS A SCALING OF SURVIVAL TIME.
